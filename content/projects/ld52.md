*Dreamcatcher* is a platformer made for Ludum Dare 52 (theme: "Harvest"). Playing as a dream harvester, you navigate a city at night — jumping between buildings, encircling dreams with the mouse to capture them before they transform into nightmares, and slashing nightmares to survive.

Free to play in the browser on itch.io.
