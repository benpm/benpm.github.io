# OpenGL Playground

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/github-repo-blue?logo=github)

A collection of graphics and simulation projects from spring 2023 coursework at the University of Utah, spanning Interactive Computer Graphics, Physics-Based Animation, and Computational Geometry. Written in C/C++ with GLSL shaders.

Features include directional, spot, and point lights with shadow mapping; interactive rigid body physics; a compute shader surface nets implementation; and a soft body physics solver.
