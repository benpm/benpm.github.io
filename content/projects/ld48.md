*I Stole a Wizard's Sack and All I Got Was This Lousy Infinite Pocket Universe* is a mind-warping puzzle game made solo for Ludum Dare 48 (theme: "Deeper and Deeper"). Built in Godot, the game features recursive, non-euclidean levels that fold in on themselves in unexpected ways. It won 2nd place in the Innovation category out of the jam's entries.

Free to play in the browser on itch.io.
