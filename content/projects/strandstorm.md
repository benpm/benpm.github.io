StrandStorm is a real-time hair rendering and simulation system built as a semester final project in spring 2023. It implements Kajiya-Kay and Marschner shading models, deep opacity maps for hair-to-hair self-shadowing, and physics-based strand simulation using discrete elastic rods with collision detection between strands and surfaces.
