Demon Island is a multiplayer open-world adventure game written from scratch in C++ using SFML for networking, graphics, and audio — around 12,000 lines of code. The world is procedurally generated, with support for interiors, a basic combat system, and multiplayer that works over the internet.

Still in active development, with NPCs and procedural dungeons planned. Follow the itch.io page for semi-frequent devlogs.
