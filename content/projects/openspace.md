# OpenSpace
*Rendering Engineer, 2025 - 2026*

At [OpenSpace](https://github.com/OpenSpace), I worked on rendering features, optimizations, and enhancements. Due to NASA funding being lost, my position was woefully short-lived, however I was able to complete several key features. My work included:

## HD Saturn Ring Shadow

## Object Shadows
