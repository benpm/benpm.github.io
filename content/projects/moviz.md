Moviz is an interactive data visualization exploring the relationship between movies, their financial performance, critical ratings (IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes), and Academy Award recognition. Built with Alper Sahistan for a Data Visualization course at the University of Utah — it won runner-up best project.

The visualization lets you explore correlations across dimensions like budget, revenue, profit, runtime, and Oscar nominations/wins through an interactive scatter plot with filtering and search.
