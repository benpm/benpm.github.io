I like to make games! I don't finish them very often, but that doesn't really matter, right?
Here are some of the notable ones I've made:

## [Demon Island](https://ben-m.itch.io/demon-island)
Work-in-progress adventure game.

Mind-bending recursive puzzle game. Made for Ludum Dare 48.

Join protagonist Groovy B, in their time-cursed Groundhog-Day-esque adventure to cure the town's government and dairy industry of cow-rruption! Made for Ludum Dare 47.

## [Npigs](https://ben-m.itch.io/npigs)
Npigs was a game I made for Ludum Dare 40 (*theme: "The more you have, the worse it is"*). It's a fairly challenging platformer with some funky clone mechanics. Your score depends on how many clones you have and how high you've climbed. There's a (probably) functioning scoreboard of top scores. The current high score is very high, so good luck beating it!

## [Rundash](https://gamejolt.com/games/rundash/511953)
Rundash is a simple multiplayer platformer where you race other players across randomly constructed levels.

## [Deep Cuts](https://gamejolt.com/games/deep-cuts/146526)
An dark, atmospheric puzzle game made for GameJolt Adventure Jam 2016. It won a judge's pick!

## [Paperlike](https://github.com/benpm/paperlike)
A simple web roguelike, originally intended to be run on the kindle paperwhite's "experimental" browser.

## [Erth](https://ben-m.itch.io/erth)
This is a pretty old one. It's a top-down RPG with crafting and building elements. It's kind of a disaster,
unbalanced and unpolished, but, hey, I made it in highschool.
