Hello! My name is Benjamin Mastripolito, and I'm a recent graduate of the University of Utah, where I studied computer graphics under the fantastic guidance of [Dr. Cem Yuksel](https://www.cemyuksel.com/students/#:~:text=Benjamin%20Mastripolito,OpenSpace). My research focused on geometry processing and 3D modeling. 

I also love to make games and have a passion for real-time physics and rendering. I have experience with a variety of graphics APIs, including OpenGL, Direct X, Vulkan, and WebGL, and I'm always eager to learn more about the latest advancements in the field. In the past, I've worked on research projects relating to parallel computing and performance analysis.
